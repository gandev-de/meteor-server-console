meteor-server-console
=====================

is a tool which connects to a [meteor](http://www.meteor.com) server running the [meteor-server-eval](https://github.com/gandev-de/meteor-server-eval) smartpackage and provides a way to evaluate javascript in the server environment.

I'm publishing meteor-server-console as a "Chrome DevTools" extension but its also possible to use it in other browsers
(just clone the repository and open meteor_console.html).

## Setup

*    OPTIONAL: install extension in your chrome (open chrome://extensions and drag and drop the .crx file)
*    add smartpackage [meteor-server-eval](https://github.com/gandev-de/meteor-server-eval) to your app
*    start your app and open meteor-server-console (appears in "Chrome DevTools" as the new Tab "Meteor Console")

## Use

### Connection
     - automatically connects to localhost:3000 by default, to change the port see Input commands 
       ("ws://localhost:3000/websocket")
     - polls the server and connects automatically when server starts/restarts

### Evaluations
     - are executed as eval(expression) in meteor node.js container, optionally scoped to package context
     - REQUIREMENT: [meteor-server-eval](https://github.com/gandev-de/meteor-server-eval)

### Input

*    general:
     - type in a expression and hit ENTER to evaluate
     - type in an object name or part of it and press CTRL + SPACE to trigger autocomplete
     - select last evaluated expressions with the UP and DOWN keys

*    server commands (helpers):
     - type . and a popup with all supported server side helper functions shows up
         - __.clear__ clear console output
         - __.toggleLogging__ toggle interception of server side logs (default: ON)
         - __.updateMetadata__ mostly internal to update metadata like supported packages/helper
         - __.git__ basically calls git in the project repository (+ shortcut commands .gitStatus/.gitDiff/...)
         __- stay tuned for scaffolding with abee and other useful helpers__

*    client commands:
     - type : and a popup with the following commands shows up
         - __:scope=package_name__ sets the package in which evaluations should be scoped if supported
         - __:reset-scope__ resets scope to global
         - __:set-port=4000__ sets the port to switch app instance
         - __:port__ shows current port
         - __:set-host=localhost__ sets the host to switch app instance
         - __:host__ shows current host
         - __:watch=expr__ add/refresh expression to/in watch view and open if closed
         - __:watch-view__ toggle watch view open/closed
         - __:watch-view60__ change watch view width in percent (arbitrary)
         - __:reload__ just reload the page

### Output (not stored in app db)

*    internal messages/ autocomplete
     - Error=red, Info=orange, SUCCESS=green
     - autocomplete displays object keys in a table and/or sets the input value to matching key

*    evaluation results
     - expression in first line (leading #), result below and scope with evaluation time in milliseconds on the right side
     - Strings, Numbers, Booleans directly
     - Objects as tree
             - different colors for different types (Function=blue, Object=green, Array=orange, Circular=red)
             - Objects are shown with name (if available) of constructor Function
             - Circular References are marked and shown with path
             - Errors with stacktrace (special format with the attempt of highlighting more relevant lines)

*    server log (see server commands)
     - leading green (or Error=red) label with static text 'Log' + log message (expandable if multi line)
     - if the server log is intercepted, all log entries will get rendered in output window
     - the calls of helper functions can also produce log entries wich are always displayed

### Watch
     - watch view, refresh and remove watches
     - watches are persistent on the server and automatically refreshed if server restarts
